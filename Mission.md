While food is essential to life, cooking your own is optional. During the long years of being a student, I've had the excuse of prioritizing my hectic education life above other necessities at times, such as cooking. I always knew that cooking my own would not be just healtier but also economical, yet I've failed to turn cooking into a habit. Waiting for the adult years to gain the habit, I was surprised to find out that life always its complexities at any stage. As an adult female taking part in the working life, I often find myself dealing with the challenging question of "what do I cook today?" and not always asked by me but also by my spouse. While admiring my own mother's years of hard-workingness and dedication to feed her family without any excuse, I would like to make the life easier with for the myself and the ones like myself who're not yet natural chef's yet want to achieve the best of themselves. 

Motivated by these, we present Sous Chef Susana, that is an conversational agent designed to foster cooking decision-making, with the features including personalization, recommendations, (real-time) cooking instructions and cooking tracking.

There exists excessive amount of cooking-related applications and social media content, and yet they seem to fail at addressing the real questions. One can be overwhelmed, for instance, in the lake of countless recipes and instructions and with ingredients that are hard to retrieve. Furthermore, gaining, improving and maintaning the habit of cooking and creating cooking plans (or just being a successful causal chef) is a personal process that implies that learnings should be collected and utilized. Existing solutions do not aim at creating personalized cooking plans built upon various stages of preperation, including introspective look over cooking history and personal preferences.

<!--Not everything can be found in the internet, such as my mom's secret recipe :))-->

that cooking sometimes can carry out family recipes. Personal cooking plans and recipes therefore can be safely stored.

4. lack of sincerity/tricks: not all recipes or instructions give away the tricks for cooking.
5. lack of customization: my oven bakes differently than the recipes suggest
6. lack of retrospective analysis ("you have not cooked veggie dishes much")
7. recommendations
  a. personal
  b. what others cook (e.g., in your region)
