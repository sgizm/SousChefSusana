* Software architecture
** General strategy
- Separation of the business logic from the implementation.
- (Dialog) Grammars are used to encode the business logic and know-how
  of the workflows.
** On-boarding module
- User profile
  - Allergies
  - Cuisine preferences
  - etc.
- Access to food
** Analytic module
- Retrospect for a single user
- Analysis of global usage / utilization
- Breakdowns of usage / utilization 
** Recommendation module
- Recipe to do today / tonight
** Cooking directions module
- For a concrete recipe what directions are given.
  - What directions to follow.
** Privacy 
- "You are what you eat."
- Opt-in and opt-out flags.
- Some recipes are shared.
- Some are available to everyone.
- Is it possible to determine health conditions from utilized recipes
  and cooking history?
* Presentations

*** DONE Abstract
*** MAYBE Paper features
- Goals
  - Is this an advertisement of the project?
    - Meaning, collaboration invitation.
  - Is this "just" know-how for embarking on a project like this?
  - Is this a show-off presentation?
    - Meaning, self-promotion.
- Message
  - From personal experiences to scaled solution
  - Global audience relevance
    - There is big picture and small picture
    - Individual user
    - Multiple users
  - Management of the project
    - How to design the features?
    - How to collaborate?
    - How to do MVP and later implementations?
  - It is shown that:
    - Design functionality for the convenience of single person (or
      household)
    - Multiple users data can be utilized for recommendations:
      - Novelty
      - Acquiring of products and tools
      - Feasibility
        - Can it be made on time?
    - Conversational agent perspective of introducing the system's functionalities
      - Brainstorming approach
      - Breakdown of functionalities and data (type, sources)
      - Breakdown of functionalities and software modules
    - System architecture
    - Data analysis
      - Introspection (single user)
        - Most popular dishes
        - Most consumed ingredients
        - Pareto principle adherence of:
          - Dishes
          - Purchases (geo-location, products)
          - Nutritional ingredients
          - Segmentation by weekday, calendar days
      - All users
        - Most popular dishes
        - Most consumed ingredients
        - Pareto principle adherence of:
  - Topics of special interest:
    - Handling misspellings
    - Audio to text
    - Scheduling of steps
    - Security and data obfuscation
    - Logistics problem formulation
      - What to products to get and steps to perform in order to get
        a dish by/at certain time?
- Design
  - Personal use
  - Scaling
*** Analogies and relations 
- This is an app mostly for women. (Say/)
  - What would be the corresponding app for men?
    - Fishing suggestion app.
