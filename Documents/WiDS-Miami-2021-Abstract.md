# Conversational agent Sous Chef Susana
### *Design of a food preparation conversational agent*
### WiDS-Miami-2021-Abstract


Assume, we would like to become better chefs or cooks since we missed the opportunity to acquire solid and practical cooking skills
during studying for many years or due to hectic work lives. 

We would like to ask an assistant (device) "What food should I prepare or cook today?".
We would like to hear answers that are both concise, fit our nutritional goals and life patterns, and are actionable. 
(With ingredients and efforts that match our lifestyles.) 

More generally, we would like to make life easier using technology for people who're not yet natural chef's 
yet want to achieve the best of themselves.

There exists an excessive amount of cooking-related applications and social media content, and 
yet they seem to fail at addressing the real needs. Existing solutions do not aim at creating personalized cooking 
plans built upon various stages of preparation, including introspective look over cooking history and personal preferences.

Motivated by these, we present Sous Chef Susana, that is a conversational agent 
designed to foster cooking decision-making, 
with the features including personalization, recommendations, (real-time) cooking instructions and cooking tracking.

In this presentation we discuss the design of the conversational agent Sous Chef Susana,
and how we research, enumerate, and prioritize the design and implementation of its (sub-)modules.

Furthermore, we are going to discuss relevant data acquisition and processing, what kind of machine learning algorithms
to be used of which functionalities. 
Susana's concrete dialogs and related user experience design are also discussed.
